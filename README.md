CS61B
=====
The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular emphasis on software and on machines from a programmer's point of view.  

1. **CS 61A** concentrates on the idea of abstraction, allowing the programmer to think in terms appropriate to the problem rather than in low-level operations dictated by the computer hardware.
2. **CS 61B** deals with the more advanced engineering aspects of software, such as constructing and analyzing large programs.
3. **CS 61C** focuses on machines and how they execute the programs you write.

CS 61A covered high-level approaches to problem-solving, providing you with a variety of ways to organize solutions to programming problems as compositions of functions, collections of objects, or sets of rules. In CS 61B, we move to a somewhat more detailed (and to some extent, more basic) level of programming.

In 61A, the correctness of a program was our primary goal. In CS61B, we’re concerned also with engineering. An engineer, it is said, is someone who can do for a dime what any fool can do for a dollar. Much of 61B will be concerned with the tradeoffs in time and memory for a variety of methods for structuring data. We’ll also be concerned with the engineering knowledge and skills needed to build and maintain moderately large programs.
